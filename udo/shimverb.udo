/* shimmer_reverb - stereo effect with reverb and spectrally processed pitch-shifted feedback
	Inputs:
		al - left input audio signal
		ar - right input audio signal 
		kpredelay - delay time in milliseconds for pre-delay of input signal before entering reverb 
		krvbfblvl - feedback setting for reverbsc (a large setting like 0.95 can be nice)
		krvbco - cutoff setting for reverbsc (affects brightness of effect)
		kfblvl - feedback amount for delayed signal that is fed back into reverb (0.45 is a good value to start with)
		kfbdeltime - delay time in milliseconds for delayed signal that is fed back into reverb (start with 100)
		kratio - amount to transpose feedback signal by. 2 transposes by octaves, 1.5 is up by fifths, etc.
